## Arrival on Xylox

After a long journey through the **Andromeda Rift**, I finally arrived on **Xylox 9**. The planetâ€™s sky is painted in hues of purple and green, a result of its dense nitrogen-rich atmosphere.

The ground below is covered in crystalline structures that hum faintly as I step. I will explore further and report back soon.
